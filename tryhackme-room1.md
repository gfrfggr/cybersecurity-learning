# TryHackMe Cybersecurity Journey

**Date started:** May 4, 2025  
**Status:** Just getting started 

## Why I’m doing this

I’m currently a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Université de Lille. I want to specialize in cybersecurity and I'm building this repository to track my learning progress and share what I discover as I complete rooms on TryHackMe.

## What’s next?

-  Create this repo
-  Start with “Introduction to Cyber Security” room
-  Take notes and publish a write-up for each room I finish

Stay tuned!
