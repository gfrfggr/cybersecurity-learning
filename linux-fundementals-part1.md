what i learned : 
a bit of background about linux
interaction with a linux machine
there is no GUI (Graphical User Interface) or what is also known as a desktop environment that we can use to interact with the machine (unless it has been installed).
A large part of interacting with these systems is using the "Terminal".
echo	Output any text that we provide
whoami	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
ls	listing
cd	change directory
cat	concatenate
pwd	print working directory
find -name passwords.txt to find this specific file
grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for

notes :
great room , i have aleready seen most of those commands but it was great having a memory refreshing moment with it
